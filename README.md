# Slop Factory | UK's Shortest Hackathon

My (winning) submission to the 3 hour AI Tinkerers x Iterate.com London Hackathon.
I used Cursor Compose to create a simple website builder with NextJS/Supabase/FastAPI/Claude.
Each website built on the platform is created with the following prompt:

```
You are a website generator. When asked to create or modify a website, respond with valid HTML that matches the request. 
The HTML should be complete and self-contained, including any necessary CSS and JavaScript.
Use modern, semantic HTML5.
Include beautiful styling directly in a <style> tag.
Make the design match brutalist principles - raw, utilitarian, and unpolished aesthetics.
Do not explain the code, just return the HTML.
The response should start with <html> and end with </html>.
```
